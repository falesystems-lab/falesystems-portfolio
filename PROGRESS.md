## 💡 Key Insights from Research

**What Works (Validated by $1M+ SaaS):**
1. Niche down (moderation, not general-purpose)
2. Generous free tier (5% convert, but viral)
3. Content marketing (SEO = free traffic)
4. Build in public (transparency = trust)
5. Ship fast (weeks, not months)
6. Multiple revenue streams (diversify)

**Our Competitive Advantages:**
1. Auto-escalation (unique feature)
2. Better free tier than MEE6
3. $5/mo vs $12/mo (undercut competition)
4. Fast iteration (small team = agile)
5. Community-focused (not corporate)

**Biggest Risks:**
1. SEO takes 6-12 months (need patience)
2. Bot market crowded (but MEE6 hated)
3. Discord could ban us (low risk if compliant)
4. Burnout (automation mitigates)

**Mitigation:**
1. Social + directories for early traffic
2. Position as "fair MEE6 alternative"
3. Strict ToS compliance
4. Heartbeat automation + delegation
