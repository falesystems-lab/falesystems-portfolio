<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo" style="max-width: 200px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
```

## 🎯 Conversion Best Practices

1. **Headline**: One clear benefit in <10 words
2. **Subheadline**: Specific result ("Save 10 hours/week")
3. **CTA Button**: Action verb ("Start Free", not "Learn More")
4. **Social Proof**: Numbers ("Join 1,000+ users")
5. **Features**: Benefits, not features ("Save time" not "Fast processing")
