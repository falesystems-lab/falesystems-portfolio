## Pricing Psychology

### 1. Anchor High
**Example:** Show $99/mo "Enterprise" tier, then $19/mo looks cheap

**Why it works:** Relativity. People don't know absolute value.

**Application:**
- Landing Page SaaS: $99/mo "Agency" tier → $29/mo "Pro" feels reasonable

---

### 2. Good-Better-Best
**Structure:** 3 tiers (not 2, not 4)

**Why it works:**
- Most people pick middle (safe choice)
- Low tier = entry point
- High tier = upsell opportunity

**Application:**
```
Basic: $9/mo (1 site, basic features)
Pro: $29/mo (5 sites, all features) ← Most popular
Agency: $99/mo (unlimited, white-label)
```

---

### 3. Annual Discount
**Structure:** Monthly + Annual (20% off)

**Why it works:**
- Upfront cash flow
- Lower churn (paid for year)
- Psychological (feels like a deal)

**Application:**
- $29/mo or $290/year (save $58)
- Promote annual heavily

---

### 4. Usage-Based
**Structure:** Pay for what you use

**Why it works:**
- Scales with customer success
- Fair perception
- High-usage customers subsidize low-usage

**Application:**
- Landing Page SaaS: $19/page or $49/mo unlimited
- Bot SaaS: Free (1 server) → $5/mo per server

---

### 5. Freemium
**Structure:** Free forever + paid upgrades

**Why it works:**
- Massive top-of-funnel
- Viral growth
- Try before buy

**Risks:**
- 95%+ stay free
- Support burden
- Freeloaders

**Application:**
- Discord Bot: Free (core features) → $5/mo (premium)

---

## Conversion Optimization Tactics

### 1. Free Trial (vs Freemium)
**Structure:** 14-day free trial of premium features

**Why it works:**
- Users experience full value
- Higher conversion than freemium (but lower signups)
- Creates urgency (trial ending)

**Best for:** Products with immediate "aha" moment

---

### 2. Onboarding Magic
**Goal:** Get user to "aha moment" in < 5 minutes

**Tactics:**
- Guided setup wizard
- Demo data pre-filled
- Success checklist
- Quick wins (see value fast)

**Example (Bot):**
- Invite bot → auto-setup with defaults
- First spam blocked → notification "See, it works!"
- Suggest next step (welcome message)

---

### 3. Email Drip Campaign
**Free user sequence:**
- Day 0: Welcome + setup help
- Day 3: Feature education (did you know?)
- Day 7: Case study (how others use it)
- Day 14: Upgrade offer (unlock premium)
- Day 30: Feedback request (improve product)
- Day 60: Re-engagement (comeback offer)

**Trial user sequence:**
- Day 1: Welcome + quick start
- Day 5: Advanced feature tip
- Day 10: Success story
- Day 12: Upgrade reminder (2 days left)
- Day 14: Last chance (trial ending)
- Day 15: Win-back offer (discount?)

---

### 4. Social Proof
**Tactics:**
- "Join 10,000+ servers using our bot"
- Testimonials with photos
- Case studies (specific results)
- Trust badges (if applicable)

**Why it works:** Herd mentality, risk reduction

---

### 5. Money-Back Guarantee
**Structure:** "30-day money back, no questions asked"

**Why it works:**
- Removes purchase risk
- Signals confidence
- Rarely claimed (< 5%)

**Application:** SaaS product especially

---

## Pricing Experiments to Run

### Test 1: Price Point
**Hypothesis:** $7/mo converts better than $5/mo (premium perception)

**Method:** A/B test, 1000 visitors each variant
**Metric:** Revenue per visitor (not just conversion!)

---

### Test 2: Annual Discount
**Hypothesis:** 30% off annual converts better than 20%

**Method:** A/B test
**Metric:** % choosing annual

---

### Test 3: Tier Names
**Hypothesis:** "Pro" sounds better than "Premium"

**Method:** A/B test
**Metric:** Click-through on pricing page

---

### Test 4: Free Trial Length
**Hypothesis:** 7 days converts better than 14 (urgency)

**Method:** Split test
**Metric:** Trial-to-paid %

---

## Churn Prevention

### Why Customers Cancel:
1. **Not using it** (didn't reach "aha")
2. **Too expensive** (value < price)
3. **Found alternative** (competitor won)
4. **Technical issues** (bugs, downtime)
5. **Business closed** (not your fault)

### Tactics:

#### 1. Usage Monitoring
- Alert when user goes inactive (7 days)
- Offer help: "Need setup help?"
- Re-engagement campaign

#### 2. Cancel Flow
- When clicking "Cancel", ask why
- Offer alternatives:
  - Pause subscription (1 month)
  - Downgrade to cheaper tier
  - Discount offer (last resort)

#### 3. Customer Success
- Proactive check-ins (monthly)
- Feature education emails
- Success stories

#### 4. Continuous Improvement
- Ship features customers request
- Fix bugs fast (< 24 hours)
- Communicate (roadmap transparency)

**Target Churn:** < 5%/month (good), < 3% (excellent)
