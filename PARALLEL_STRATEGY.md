## 🎨 Design Philosophy: "Professional Simplicity"

**Why most indie projects fail visually:**
- Over-designed (too many colors, animations)
- Under-designed (looks like 2010)
- Inconsistent branding

**Our Design System:**

### Color Palette
- Primary: Orange (#FF6B35) → Energy, urgency
- Secondary: Red (#FF3D00) → Action, power
- Dark: #1a1a2e → Professional, focus
- Accent: White/Gray → Clarity

### Typography
- Headers: Bold, large (48-72px desktop)
- Body: 18-20px (readability)
- Monospace for code snippets

### Components
- Glassmorphism cards (modern, trendy)
- Gradient buttons with glow on hover
- Smooth animations (not distracting)
- Mobile-first (60% of traffic)

### Landing Pages (3 separate sites)

**1. Main Portfolio** (falesystems-lab.github.io/falesystems-portfolio)
- Services overview
- Links to bot + blog
- Contact form

**2. Bot Landing Page** (falesystems-bot.github.io or custom domain)
- Focused on bot features
- Pricing comparison vs MEE6
- Live demo / invite link
- Testimonials

**3. Blog/Affiliate Site** (falesystems.blog or Medium initially)
- Content-first design
- Sidebar with affiliate promos
- Email signup prominent
- Related posts for internal linking
