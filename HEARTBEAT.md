## Execution Logic

**Each heartbeat (1-2x daily):**

1. Check if any IMMEDIATE revenue tasks pending → do 1
2. If no urgent revenue tasks, work on bot OR content (rotate)
3. Update checkboxes here
4. Commit progress
5. Log in memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
6. If completed significant milestone → report to FaLe
7. If nothing urgent → HEARTBEAT_OK

**Current Priority:** 
Week 1 = Revenue first (Reddit posts, outreach) → funds bot hosting

## Metrics to Track

**Track daily in memory files:**
- Reddit posts made (links)
- Discord servers contacted
- Blog posts published
- Email signups
- Revenue (any!)

**Target Week 1:** First $100 to fund bot hosting
