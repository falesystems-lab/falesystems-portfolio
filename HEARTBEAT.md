## Revenue Automation - Daily Tasks

Check: revenue-automation/marketing-plan.md

**Every heartbeat (1-2x daily):**

1. Check if there are tasks for today in marketing-plan.md
2. If yes: work on 1-2 tasks, update checkboxes, commit progress
3. Log work done in memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
4. If completed something significant: report to FaLe
5. If nothing urgent: HEARTBEAT_OK

**Current focus:** Week 1 foundation - get portfolio deployed + first marketing posts out
