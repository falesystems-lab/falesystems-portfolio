## Thread #1: What Makes Landing Pages Convert

**Hook Tweet:**
```
I've built 100+ landing pages.

Here's what separates a 2% conversion rate from a 15% conversion rate 🧵

(Most people get #3 completely wrong)
```

---

**Tweet 2:**
```
1. Speed is everything.

Your landing page takes 3 seconds to load?

40% of visitors just left.

Every extra second = 7% conversion drop.

Compress images. Remove unnecessary scripts. Use a CDN.

Target: < 2 seconds load time.
```

---

**Tweet 3:**
```
2. Your headline decides everything in 5 seconds.

Bad: "Welcome to [Company Name]"
Bad: "Innovative solutions for modern businesses"

Good: "Build landing pages in 30 minutes"
Good: "Ship faster with the best DX"

Clear > Clever.
```

---

**Tweet 4:**
```
3. Social proof is non-negotiable.

New brand? Nobody trusts you yet.

Add:
• Testimonials (with photos)
• Numbers ("10,000+ users")
• Logos (clients, features)
• Case studies

Pro tip: Offer free work for testimonials if you're starting.
```

---

**Tweet 5:**
```
4. One page = One goal.

Too many CTAs = decision paralysis.

❌ "Get Started" + "Request Demo" + "Download Guide" + "Watch Video"

✅ ONE primary CTA, repeated 2-3 times down the page.

Keep it simple.
```

---

**Tweet 6:**
```
5. Mobile = 60% of your traffic.

If your site doesn't work on mobile, you're ignoring 60% of potential customers.

Design mobile-first:
• Min font size: 16px
• Tap targets: 44x44px
• Single column layout
• Test on REAL devices
```

---

**Tweet 7:**
```
Bonus: Use the 5-Second Test.

Show your landing page to someone unfamiliar.

5 seconds later, ask:
• What do we do?
• Who is it for?
• What problem do we solve?

Can't answer? Your value prop is broken.
```
