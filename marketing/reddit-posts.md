## r/Entrepreneur Post (Blog Share)

**Title:**
```
5 Landing Page Mistakes That Are Killing Your Conversions (and how to fix them)
```

**Body:**
```
I've built 100+ landing pages over the years. Here are the most common mistakes I see (and how to avoid them).

---

## 1. **Slow Loading Speed**

**Problem:** Page takes > 3 seconds to load → 40% of visitors bounce

**Fix:**
- Optimize images (use WebP, compress)
- Minimize JavaScript
- Use a CDN
- Enable caching

**Tool:** Google PageSpeed Insights

---

## 2. **Unclear Value Proposition**

**Problem:** Visitor lands on your page and thinks "...what is this?"

**Fix:**
- Hero headline should explain what you do in 5-7 words
- Subheadline expands on the benefit
- CTA button should be specific ("Get your free template" not "Learn more")

**Example:**
❌ "Welcome to our innovative platform"
✅ "Build landing pages in 30 minutes"

---

## 3. **No Social Proof**

**Problem:** New visitors don't trust you yet

**Fix:**
- Add testimonials (with photos if possible)
- Show metrics ("Used by 10,000+ people")
- Display logos (clients, features, certifications)
- Include case studies

---

## 4. **Too Many CTAs**

**Problem:** Visitor has 5 different buttons and doesn't know what to click

**Fix:**
- ONE primary CTA per page
- Secondary CTAs should be visually distinct (outline button vs filled)
- Remove distractions (unnecessary links, pop-ups)

---

## 5. **Not Mobile-Optimized**

**Problem:** 60%+ of traffic is mobile, but your site only works on desktop

**Fix:**
- Design mobile-first
- Test on real devices
- Ensure buttons are easy to tap (min 44x44px)
- Simplify navigation on mobile

---

**Bonus tip:** Use heatmaps (Hotjar, Microsoft Clarity - both have free tiers) to see where people click and scroll.

## Karma Building Strategy

**Before posting offers:**

- Build account age (Reddit prefers accounts > 7 days)

**Good subreddits for karma:**
- r/webdev (answer technical questions)
- r/learnprogramming (help beginners)
- r/freelance (share experiences)
- r/Entrepreneur (give advice)
