## Risk Management

### If Bot Doesn't Take Off:
**Pivot:** Focus 100% on affiliate + SaaS
**Timeline:** Month 3 decision point

### If Affiliate is Slow:
**Normal:** SEO takes 6-12 months
**Action:** Double down on social traffic (Twitter, YouTube)

### If SaaS Fails to Launch:
**Delay:** Launch month 8 instead of month 4
**Focus:** Perfect bot + affiliate first

### If Revenue Stalls:
**Diagnosis:** Check each funnel stage
- Traffic down? → SEO issue
- Conversion down? → Product issue
- Churn up? → Retention issue

## Investment Required

## The Flywheel

**How it compounds:**

1. **Content → Traffic**
   - More posts = more rankings = more traffic

2. **Traffic → Conversions**
   - More visitors = more installs/customers

3. **Customers → Revenue**
   - More customers = more MRR

4. **Revenue → Investment**
   - More money = better tools, ads, help

5. **Investment → Growth**
   - Better resources = faster execution = more content → (loop restarts)

**Timeline:**
- Months 1-3: Slow (building foundation)
- Months 4-6: Acceleration (flywheel kicks in)
- Months 7-12: Exponential (compound effects)

---

## Adjustments Based on Data

**Every 2 weeks, ask:**
1. What's working? (Double down)
2. What's not working? (Cut or fix)
3. What's the bottleneck? (Focus here)

**Example Pivots:**
- If Twitter blows up → prioritize social over SEO
- If Bot converts well → delay SaaS, focus here
- If one affiliate kills it → write more in that niche

**Principle:** Data > assumptions. Adjust fast.
